# **Resume Builder**
## **About**
<font size="40"> This tool aims to connect employers and employees with ease. The resume builder tool uses `__JavaFX__` as a graphical user interface along with SQL to store user details used for authentication through login forms using JavaFX field components. Further, uses `__Apache POI__` that parses the word documents and creates paragraphs, and then creates runs that represent a contiguous range of user’s resume text components. The employee can forward their resumes to the employer’s mail using `__JavaMail library__`. The JavaMail API setups a session that encapsulates the server properties such as hostname, port number, and authentication settings. It then retrieves messages from the mailbox using the __IMAP protocol__. The employer can also log in to the application and then can filter out only emails from individuals who have sent resumes. The employer can reply to the employee using automated text replies to the employee’s mail. </font>
